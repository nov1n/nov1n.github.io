My adventure in China has come to an end. After 5 months away from home I am back home. Without a doubt the most fun months in my life so far. In the last month my classes were finished and I had plenty of time to work on all the remaining items on my bucket list.

Chinese are famous for eating everything. Well not exactly everything but almost. I challenged myself to eat the craziest thing I could find. When my friend Kai told me she knew a street in Wangfujing which is famous for exotic Chinese delicacies, it did not take long before we visited. After walking up and down the street we settled for three freshly fried and seasoned scorpions on a stick. To my amazement she had no problem eating the first one. To preserve my man card I had no choice but to eat the other two, and so I did. The mere sight of these monsters gave me shivers, but they did not taste as bad as they looked. All the fried food in China uses the same spices so it all tastes similar. After getting rid of the scorpion legs between my teeth I proudly sdjklklds

Next up was South-Korea, home of fast wifi, hipster coffee places and beautiful people. Soyeon Kim, a Korean girl I'd met in Beijing offered to be my tour guide for a few days and showed me the best places in Seoul. This made my trip so much smoother as she knew the way and happens to be an excellent planner as well. Korea has a lot to offer and is one of my favorite cities in the world. It is much calmer that Beijing and the culture is more similar to Western culture which it easier to feel at home.

Food is excellent if you like spicy and rice. My favorite dish is Tteokbokki; rice cakes in a spicy red sauce. If I manage to find a good Korean restaurant this is definately something I want to try again.

The last day in Korea I managed to cross another bucket list item off my list. We stayed the night in a temple high up in the mountains with buddhist monks. These monks have been living a very traditional lifestyle for hundreds of years. Amazingly enough almost nothing has changed over the years.
Upon arrival we were handed traditional clothes to wear. Everyone wears the same as equality is an essential teaching of buddhism. Men and women sleep separated tiny wooden cabins. A thin mattress is provided to sleep on. The so called 'Ondol' which is a type of underfloor heating widely used in Korea keeps you warm at night. This was very much necessary as the clothes were thin and it was -15 degrees outside.
Around 5pm we had dinner, after which the monks performed the evening ritual. The intent is to let the sound of the drum resonate in the minds of sentient beings and awaken them to the truth of the Buddha-Dharma. Four different drums, each addressing different beings.
After the evening ritual the monks prayed for several hours and went to sleep. The next morning we woke up at 4am to perform 108 bows. This is a meditative practice that encourages reflection and concentration. Each bow consists of standing up, getting back on your knees and touching the ground with your forehead. It was freezing as the temples do not have proper heating.
The monks who live in the temples meditate about 6-8 hours every day. As use of electronic devices is strongly discouraged and I had read the welcome manual about three times by now, I decided to meditate for an hour straight. The first 10 minutes were good, I felt calm and my mind quite empty. By the thirtieth minute my leg started to tingle. Sitting cross-legged for extended periods of time apparently makes your legs go numb. By fifty minutes I stopped feeling my leg completely shortly after which it started to hurt. A lot. The last ten minutes were torturous but I made it through.
It was an interesting experience.

Before going back to Europe I stopped in Hong Kong. This city is famous for its tall buildings, cheap gadgets and narrow crowded streets. As it has been a British colony for a long time, the western influence is clearly noticable. I stayed in a hostel with a street performer clown, a movie editor and a freelance web developer. The mix of backgrounds and cultures made for interesting conversations and good travel partners.
The highlight of this trip was, without a doubt, the Peak. A hill from where the beauty of Hong Kong's skyline becomes crystal clear.

To everyone I met along the way, I cannot thank you enough for making the trip as memorable as it was. To my friends and family, thank you for reading this. To everyone who has a chance to go out and see the world, please do. You will not regret it and if you do I will refund your trip. Just kidding, but please do.

Cheers.
