On the morning of 20th of August 2017 my heavy-eyed face strolled through the revolving doors of Eindhoven airport. It was still early and cold and far from Delft, but the flight was cheap. The night before I had carefully distributed my belongings across the two pieces of lugguage I was allowed to take with me. Contents included pans, a stack of printed pictures, a (possibly too) limited set of clothes, and a feather-snowman-dreamcatcher my cousin had made for me over summer. At the self check-in the machine showed my suitcase to be 4kg above the weight limit. At home I had carefully weighed it to prevent this from happening. I stubbornly tried out all of the self-service belts, but they all pointed towards every teenage girl's worst nightmare; my suitcase had gained significant weight overnight. To be safe I bought a suitcase belt to prevent my bursting suitcase from bursting as a result of being thrown in the belly of the plane. I also paid the your-lugguage-is-too-heavy fee and moved on to security.

The queue was long. In front of me was a woman who looked nervous. She was white knuckling her purple carry on bag. Either because she was exporting illigal amounts of Gouda cheese, or because she was afraid to miss her flight. It was my turn; "Do you have any laptops, camera's, ipads sir?" I put my electronics on the tray, followed by the coffee receipts and spare buttons from my pockets. I swaggered through the metal beeping machine, which gave me a green light. In front of me stood the purple bag lady screaming at the officer who pointed out that she could not take her 200ml coco mademoiselle on the plane. Meanwhile the small wheels of the conveyor belt turned 45 degrees, as my bag rolled over to the track behind the glass for inspection. I explained the security officer that the 'radio device' he had found was a wifi receiver, and that it would do no harm. He briefly looked at me with suspicion and put the device back down. "Enjoy your flight, sir." When I walked away towards my gate, the lady was still there, she must have really liked that perfume.

## Welcome to Sweden
1200km north and two hours after my departure the boeing touched the runway of Arlanda airport. Two very Swedish looking girls of about my age were standing with a sign that read "KTH STUDENTS". They were part of the welcome committee of Kungliga Techniska Hogskolan, the university where I would study for the upcoming year. We walked towards a bus that slowly filled up with slightly uneasy strangers from all over the world. Strangers who would later become my fellow students, friends, flatmates and neighbors. There were not enough seats so I sat in the guide seat next to the driver. I tried to make conversation, but he was not very talkative. Throughout the trip he put small sachets of tobacco between his lip and teeth. This so called [snus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snus) is the Swedish equivalent of smoking and destroys gums instead of lungs. The traffic was particularly bad that day, and it took us close to three hours to the center of Stockholm.

## Lappkärrsberget
It was still the 20th of August, and the room where I would stay was still under construction. Lucky for me we were welcome to sleep at Jim's place at Lappkärrsberget or 'Lappis' as most people called it. This is the student epicenter of Stockholm. The main square with barbecues, a ping pong table, a supermarket, and a sportsbar is surrounded by over 2000 accomodations, housing a good portion of KTH and Stockholm Univerity's students. We had wholegrain bread with nutella for dinner and went to sleep. The next morning we went out for breakfast to one of many tiny cafés in Stockholm. Sweden has high standards when it comes to coffee, which is reflected by the wide variety of beans and brewing methods to choose from. After cleaning the croissant crumbles from my cheecks we moved on to see the city.

Stockholm stretches across 14 islands, each with its own character. We first went to Gamla Stan or 'Old City', the well preserved medieval city center. With its souvenir shops, the nobel museum and narrow winding cobblestone streets, it is one of my favorite places as of yet. We followed a touristic route along all the main attractions and found a very traditional burger joint to try typical swedish hamburgers with cheddar and bacon and ketchup and mayonnaise. That Tuesday night I sat in Jim's room practicing Swedish vocabulary for my 3-day Duolingo streak, when I heard muffled screams. My gut churned. They became louder and louder and as I looked outside I saw most of the people hanging out of their windows screaming their lungs out into the night sky. After a minor heart attack I was told this so called 'Lappis scream' is an old tradition taking place every Tuesday to destress from long dark winters, housing shortage, and student debt. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_rttgtyigc) is a video to get an idea.

## Noble goals
We had many introductory activities including a welcome ceremony in the Stockholm City Hall. Every year a dinner takes place in this hall hosting all Nobel Prize recipients. The president of the Nobel Museum gave a lighthearted speech about how all these legendary figures had once sat on our chairs, and that we should all win a Nobel Prize. It sounded like good advice. My first step towards this noble goal was buying a second hand bike the next day. It broke down the day after so it was not a very good start. That week I also visited a handful of museums, got a student card, participated in free tours around Stockholm, and lost repeatedly at ping-pong against Chinese flatmates. All in all it's been a great week filled with many new impressions and experiences. I look forward to moving into my own place and starting classes. The next episode includes a famous astronaut, strollers, and an unexpected trip to Ikea so stay tuned!
