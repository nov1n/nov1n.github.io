It was 7 september 2015, the cab dropped me off at the northeast gate of Tsinghua University. This is where I would spend the better part of the upcoming 6 months. I dragged my clunky lugguage over the cobblestones and headed towards the reception for foreign students. Tsinghua provides on campus dormitories for over 3000 international students. The lady behind the counter gave me a key and told me I stayed in building 6. I knocked on the door, a friendly looking Chinese guy greeted me and asked me if he could help. I looked past him and saw 2 bunk beds and clothes all over the floor. A strong smell of old noodles and dirty socks hit me. Hesitatingly I told him that I was his new roommate and showed him the key. He told me he already had three roommates and that this building was for Asian students only. Indeed we tried the key and it did not fit in the lock. As I've repeatedly noted, most of the Chinese are very helpful including this young man. He walked me to the building's main office where I learned that there are two buildings with the number 6. The one I was looking for was at the other side of the campus. My new Chinese friend was kind enough to accompany me and we found it. 'Asian Youth Center', a sign above the main entrance read. I thanked him and took the elevator to the second floor. The white walls and the shiny floor made the corridor look somewhat like a hospital. The picture below shows a picture of my room, which fortunately looks a lot better.

The first week was mostly spent on dull administrative tasks. These include but are not limited to acquiring a student card, cafeteria card, residence permit, water dispenser, a guitar and a bike. As the campus is very large, bikes are very popular among Tsinghua's students. The lack of traffic rules and the fact that most Chinese have never touched a bike before they got here, make cycling somewhat of a challenge.

At the end of the week I picked my courses whose subjects vary from IT to financial management and microelectronics.

This weekend me and 5 friends whom I met in the dorm visited the great wall. We woke up early to avoid traffic jams and the majority of the tourists. At 7.30AM our driver picked us up at the east gate of the campus. After about two hours we arrived at the destination. From there we took a shuttle bus and a cable car to reach the top of the wall.
