It was 7 september 2015, the cab dropped me off at the northeast gate of Tsinghua University. This is where I would spend the better part of the upcoming 6 months. I dragged my clunky lugguage over the cobblestones and headed towards the reception for foreign students. Tsinghua provides on campus dormitories for over 3000 international students, many of them standing in front of me in the queue. The lady behind the counter gave me a key and told me I stayed in building 6. After a quick look on the campus map I found the building was not far from where I was. Upon arrival I knocked on the door. A friendly looking Chinese student greeted me and asked if he could help. Looking past him I saw two bunk beds and clothes all over the floor. A strong smell of old noodles and dirty socks hit me. Hesitatingly I told him that I was his new roommate and showed him the key. He told me he already had three roommates and that this building was for Asian students only. Indeed we tried the key and it did not fit in the lock. As I've repeatedly noted, most of the Chinese are very helpful including this young man. He walked me to the building's main office where I learned that there are two buildings with the number 6. The one I was looking for was at the other side of the campus. Great. Luckily my new Chinese friend was kind enough to accompany me and we found it. 'Asian Youth Center', a sign above the main entrance read. I thanked him and took the elevator to the second floor. The white walls and the shiny floor made the corridor look somewhat like a hospital. The picture below shows a picture of my room, which fortunately looks a lot better.

The first week was mostly spent on dull administrative tasks. These include but are not limited to acquiring a student card, cafeteria card, residence permit, water dispenser, a guitar and a bike. As the campus is very large, bikes are very popular among Tsinghua's students. The lack of traffic rules and the fact that most Chinese have never touched a bike before they got here, make cycling somewhat of a challenge. [This](https://goo.gl/photos/Yx5W6HEWrQdUcGys6) short video should give you an idea. At the end of the week I picked my courses whose subjects vary from introductory Chinese to financial management and microelectronics. 

The food card allows students to eat in one of the many cafeteria on campus for about 1-2 euros. The dishes vary from traditional Chinese noodles to a western pasta bolognese. As I was not familiar with most of the food, and all the descriptions are in Chinese, eating felt a bit like playing russian roulette. One day I'd pick a juicy chicken breast with rice and broccoli, the other day a curry so spicy even the Indian students avoid it. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

About five bus stops away from the campus lies the bird nest. This is the stadium built for the olympic games in 2008. At night it is illuminated and packed with people. As we walked around a Chinese looking family came up to me. The father raised his hands making wild gestures. He wanted a picture I figured. Gladly I held out my hands but he did not give me his camera. Instead he looked a bit confused. Saying something intelligibly he pointed at me and then at my friend, a tall girl from Estonia. After an exchange of awkward stares it was clear he wanted to take a picture of his family, with us. Tall Europeans are popular photo subjects in Asia, I then learned.
