I spent the weekend in Harbin which was without a doubt one of the coolest (literally!) places I've ever been to. It lies north east of Beijing and it takes about 8 hours by train to get there. This city is famous for the world's biggest snow and ice festival each winter. It hosts an international ice sculpture competition where artists from all around the world visit Harbin to create the most beautiful chilly art.
The sculptures can be found in a temporary city built completely out of ice and snow. The city contains palaces and castles much like Disney Land.

My hostel was near the main street in Harbin. It was surrounded by trees and lights similar to a christmas market. Many stalls sold a wide variety of local goods. Frozen fruits on a stick are a very popular snack. One ice cream stand carved chunks of ice from a big block and dipped them into syrup.
Now Harbin is very, very cold. That night it was about 25 degrees below zero. I learned that this means no matter what you wear, you will still be cold. Every twenty minutes I would walk into a souvenir shop pretending to be very interested in their dried plums and fake liquor when in reality I was slowly regaining feeling in the tips of my fingers.

At the end of the street I found a frozen lake. This seemed to be a meeting place for locals as it was very busy here. Kids were ice skating and sledding. Adults were driving snow scooters, buggies and horses. It was a very intersting display. I found this one kid who seemed like he regretted his decision to go tubing.

It was time for the ice festival. I bought several heat packs to put in my shoes and gloves. Even with these, it was not exaclty warm but atleast I would not lose any toes along the way. Bringing water bottles I was very prepared. The only problem being that they turned into a solid block of ice within about an hour. A good way for the park to boost its drink sales.

Whenever I took off my gloves to reach for my phone, I had exactly 20 seconds before I stopped feeling my fingers. At this point I envied the gloves that work on smartphones. I later figured out how to unlock it with my nose and take pictures with the volume buttons which worked surprisingly well.
Cold and batteries don't go together that well either. My first camera battery died in about an hour, even though it was off most of the time. My phone kept shutting off every so often. I was clearly not the only one struggling with the cold. Attaching a heat pad to my camera's battery compartment and to the back of my phone seemed to solve the problem.

Later that night the host in my hostel invited me to visit his friend. He also had a hostel a couple of blocks down the road. Twenty students from Thailand were staying for a school trip. We spent the night playing table football, xbox and a card game which I did not quite understand, probably because my Thai still needs some work.

When I woke up the next morning several Chinese invited me to get lunch at a traditional place. An offer I could not refuse. I had my fair share of local delicacies including chicken stomach, chicken intestines and a pig's ear. Luckily for me there were some dishes that I could stomach more easily. They helped me find me a taxi and off I went, back to Beijing.
