As I cycled to class I came across an English banner. This caught my attention because practically everything on campus is in Chinese. "Join the CAMP competition and win a trip to Australia" it said. This looked like a good opportunity to meet like-minded Chinese as well as International people from Beijing, so I signed up. Two days later me and two of my friends from the dorm took the subway. We ended up in a very poor part of the city. Walking in circles we kept telling we were not lost. Right when we decided to turn around, a tall blonde girl appeared and walked towards us. She said we were not lost but in fact two streets away from our destination.

Passing through what looked like an art exposition led us to a large hall where the competition would take place. It had an industrial look similar to the upscale coffee shops and pop-up stores slowly taking over major cities. After a short introduction we went through several ice-breaking activities to get to know the people around us. I met a Dutch girl and a Japanese girl with whom I formed a team.

The objective was to design a product that facilitates international communication. After several hours of fruitless brainstorming, we agreed on an idea. I was lucky to have two very artistic individuals in my team. One of them spun up a storyboard in about 10 minutes as the other sketched a wireframe displaying the application's features. We pitched the idea to the Australian jury panel and incredibly enough won the competition. This means sometime around June next year, we will go to Sydney for a week. Awesome.

## Golden week
The golden week is from 1 to 7 oktober. It is a national holiday in which most of China goes traveling around the country. In the spirit of 'act like a local' I booked a train ticket to Datong, a famous city to the west of Beijing. Armed with my backpack and my passport I took a taxi, arriving the Beijing West train station at around 11:00PM. I could not read the seat number on my ticket, so I repeatedly handed it to staff members at different carriages, until one pointed at the door. The coach was dark and filled with triple bunk beds. As I climbed a tiny ladder to reach the top bed I bumped my head. This place was clearly not made with tall Europeans in mind. I woke up about four more people before I finally reached the bed. Using my backpack as a pillow, paranoid of losing my passport and being deported, I slowly fell asleep. 

Twenty minutes later I woke up. Someone was shining a big flashlight in my eye. I was barely awake and looked down. A crew member said something unintelligible to me and signaled me to come down. I tried to play the dumb tourist by going back to sleep but it did not take long before he climbed up the ladder and started yanking my foot. 

Walking to my new bed felt a bit like trying to reach the front row at a concert. The pathway was full of standing people. I could not imagine standing for 7 hours straight but they did not seem to mind. The ones too weak to stand lay on the floor. Some were asleep, others furiously playing Candy Crush on their iPhone 6. As my crew member friend elbowed his way through, my backpack and I were not very good at maneuvering through the crowd. Finally I made it to my bed and slept the rest of the journey.

At around 6:00AM I arrived at Datong. I brushed off 4 taxis and 3 souvenir ladies and headed towards a hostel I had booked shortly before falling asleep in the train. It was supposed to be an international youth hostel but everyone staying there spoke Chinese, and looked Chinese. The host spoke no English, surprise. After a few blank stares which I knew so well by now, he gave me a key and pointed at a bed which I supposed was mine.

My high-calorie peanutbutter sandwiches kept me alive for a while but now I had to resort to other means. It was time to find a place to eat something other than pork claw, chicken head or pig's blood tofu which were prominently displayed at every street corner. I came across a food cart across the street who made pancakes. As I was starving, hygiene was not a top priority and I ordered one. The pancake looks similar to a French crÃªpe with chicken, eggs, lettuce. They taste amazing.

The next two days I met up with a few friends who happened to also be in Datong. We vistited several touristic attractions such as the hanging temple, a monastery built into a cliff, and the yungang grottoes, a Buddhist sculptural site.

Time to take a train to Taiyuan, a city about 5 hours south of Datong. My new host offered cooking traditional Chinese food for me. Of course I could not refuse this generous offer. At dinner time I was presented with a wide array of local delicacies. These included the infamous pork claw, chicken hearts, chicken feet and bird eggs. Although most of them tasted okay, they did not look very appealing. In the course of the last few weeks I had become more and more confident about my chopstick skills. That all changed when a noodle slipped through my chopsticks splashing soup all over the room. I really tried to be a polite guest but the universe was working against me.

The next day I met up with a Chinese young man whom I had met in Datong. He offered to show me around Jinsi Temple, as he was familiar with the place. In the evening we had so called "hotpot". Through the restaurant ran a conveyor belt, similar to the one for your lugguage at the airport. Small bowls of food circled around the tables. Everyone could take whatever they liked and cook it in a small pot of hot water. I curiously asked my friend "What's that?" every few seconds, as the strangest looking things passed by. It was a fun way to try a lot of different kinds of food.

The last stop was Pingyao, an ancient Chinese city surrounded by city walls. Although I have heard many of the buildings have been rebuilt, the place is very good at fooling tourists they just went 3000 years back in time. The Chinese architecture and cobblestone roads give the place a mystic feel. While walking around I met a Chinese couple who invited me to get dinner with them and some of their friends. One of them had a three year old toddler who effortlessly ate his rice with chopsticks. The waitress brought me a spoon, which I think implied I was not doing too well this time either.

A 9 hour train ride returned me safely to Beijing. After rewarding myself with a McChicken and a Coke I took a cab home and crashed out. Till next time!
