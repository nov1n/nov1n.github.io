## Beijing adventure - Part 5

[[images/shanghai.jpg]]

Shanghai is very different from Beijing in a lot of ways. For one, it feels much more like a western city. The vast majority of the so called Shanghainese speak fluent English and are more than happy to have a conversation with you. A lot of the buildings look very western. 

Pudong or financial district is a part of Shanghai. This part is famous for its tall buildings including the famous Pearl Tower. A river separates pudong from the bund. This is the place from where the famous skyline pictures are taken. The iconic buildings at Pudong light up at night reflecting in the river. 

When leaving the aircraft I could barely breathe. After a quick glance on my phone I read headlines such as 'Beijing air pollution reaches extremely hazardous levels'. Apparently the PM2.5 was over 2000 in some places while the scale only goes to 500.
