From September till the end of January I'll be studying at Tsinghua University in Beijing. That adventure started a few days ago. It was Thursday 3 September when the taxi dropped me off at Denpansar airport, Bali. After staying in Indonesia for three weeks it was time to leave. I kindly thanked the driver and headed for the nearest check-in counter. Shortly after placing my suitcase on the conveyor belt the lady kindly informed me it was 5kg overweight. I nodded and asked her how much it would cost. She took a calculator, pressed several buttons in rapid succession and turned the display towards me. It displayed 1.550.000. My heart skipped a beat. Converting the amount from Indonesian Rupiah to Euros I learned 5kg of excess luggage cost me €98.

'Cabin crew, please be seated for landing', my eyes slowly opened. The Chinese capital, in all its beauty, lay beneath me as I looked out the window. Not much later the wheels touched ground. After the usual rush to leave the aircraft I first set foot on Chinese territory. It was cold and dark outside.

I headed towards the KFC and pointed at the biggest chicken burger on the menu. The lady across the counter said something I did not understand and looked at me questioningly. I think she expected me to reply in fluent Chinese but I had to disappoint her instead. My next challenge was to secure the Wifi password. Handing her my phone and pointing at the wifi network worked surprisingly well. I opened G-mail and wrote an e-mail to my parents letting them know I was safe. 'Could not send mail', the error message read. After checking Facebook, Google Maps, all of which did not work it dawned on me. The [great firewall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Shield_Project) was causing me all this trouble. It blocks internet access to many websites including all of Google's services, Facebook and several news sources. The TU Delft provides a free [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) for all students which allowed me to circumvent these restrictions.

By this time it was early in the morning. As my dorm was not yet available I had booked a room through [Airbnb](http://airbnb.com/) for the next three nights. I messaged David, the host, if he could come and pick me up. He replied 'Sorry forgot, I am out of town', followed by 'let me think'. This was not exactly what I needed to hear after 36 hours of being awake. He then said his friend Johnny would be able to help me until he was back in town. We would meet in Wudaukou, the student area of Beijing.

As soon as I left the airport all information was only in Chinese. It did not take long before I realized nobody spoke English either. Luckily I had my 'Chinese travel phrases' pocket guide which helped me a great deal explaining the police officer I had lost my subway ticket. Upon arrival in Wudaokou I had no idea where to go. A huge, thick cloud of haze hung over the capital which limited the view to about 50 meters. Around me were Chinese people staring me down, most of them wearing surgeon masks. I felt slightly out of place but was relieved when I found 'Tous les jours', a French bakery. After the most European baguette you can imagine I felt much better, though still very tired. I installed WeChat which is the Chinese equivalent of Whatsapp, and shared my location with Johnny. He told me I could stay at his place until David came home. I slept on his couch for most of the afternoon. In the evening we had dinner with his girlfriend and some of his friends, all international students in Beijing.

After dinner we took a taxi to David's place. The building was located next to the campus and looked like a soviet bunker. It even had an air defense basement. You know, just in case... The room was in better shape, it had air conditioning, a balcony and even a treadmill to stay fit. Tomorrow I will move into my dorm on campus. More on that in part 2.

Thank you for reading till the end. Feel free to leave an encouraging message below.

下次见到你!
