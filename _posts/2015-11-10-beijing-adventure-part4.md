Two weeks ago my parents arrived at Beijing Capital International Airport. Through weekly Skype sessions I have tried to explain the cultural differences but my words were inadequate. The photographs I made did a better job at describing what life was like here. Now they could see it for themselves.

On Tuesday we visited the Summer Palace, an imperial garden very close from my university. In 1998 the garden was added to the World Heritage List, described as 'a masterpiece of Chinese landscape and garden design'. It was very foggy that day which limited visibility but created a mysterious atmosphere. Below is a picture of the marble boat which was one of my favorite pavilions.

Later that week we took the bullet train to Xi'an, the capital of the Shaanxi province. It lies 1100 kilometers south south-west of Beijing. With a top speed well over 300 km/h, the train 'only' took 5 hours to get there.

Upon arrival we had a delicious steak and a pasta carbonara. I had lived on rice and chicken for two months by this point. You can imagine delighted I was.

The next day we headed to the terracotta warriors. This is a tomb containing approximately 8000 sculptures made from terracotta. The project involved 700.000 workers and started in 250 BC, when Emperor Qin was only 13. It was only recently discovered by a farmer digging a well. He now sits behind a desk at the entrance of the mausoleum every day. For about 30 euros he will sign a book about the place and let you take a picture with him. My mother could not resist his charm and bought the book, after which a happy family picture followed.

In the evening we had a dumpling dinner, which as the name suggests, consisted solely of dumplings. The dinner was in a theater accompanied by a traditional Chinese dance performance. Even though I was still in china, I'd never seen so many middle-aged white people in one room. 

Back in Beijing I woke up the next day. As I looked out of the window it was snowing. The leaves had just turned yellow and at the same time everything was covered in snow. Two weeks ago I remember it being 20 degrees as we sat in the park in a t-shirt. Nature supposedly forgot about fall and rushed straight into winter.

Other than cold pollution has been worsening by the day as well. It is a big problem in China and many are wearing masks to protect them from the so called PM2.5 particles in the air. These are produced by the factories in the city outskirts. When there is no wind a thick haze covers the streets. Breathing this air feels like breathing through a straw and is uncomfortable to say the least. As a protective measure I created a DIY air cleaner to keep me safe in my room. It looks very primitive but judging from the fact that the filter turned all black in a matter of weeks, I like to tell myself that it helps at least a little bit.

That's it for this one. Zàijiàn!
